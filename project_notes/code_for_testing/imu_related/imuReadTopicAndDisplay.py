'''

The script subscribes to the ROS topic "/imu/data" to receive IMU data. It then processes this data by converting 
the orientation quaternion to Euler angles, focusing on the yaw angle to calculate the heading in degrees. The 
script continuously prints the current heading, providing a simple way to monitor and verify the output of 
my IMU.

Additionally it reads and prints the non-standard magnetometer accuracy data that is stored in a covariance field.
