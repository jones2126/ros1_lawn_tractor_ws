lastIndex = len(list_of_waypoints) - 1
while OK_to_proceed and lastIndex > target_idx:
if distance to goal > look ahead distance
	calculate a interim goal and break the loop
if we are on the last waypoint 
	we need a special look ahead distance goal
If the goal is reached stop moving
If the goal is not reached keep calculating steering angle and moving to the goal
Publish debug data

for waypoints in mission:
	P1, P2, A = waypoints

	calculate_steer_angle()
	plot_values()


If the current position + look ahead distance > goal then get the next waypoint as the goal.  If you are on the final waypoint then keep steering to that point
